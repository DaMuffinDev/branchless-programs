[COMMANDS]:
    - cd <file name>
    - view <file name>

[CD COMMAND]:
    Navigates you to the specified file name, if it does not exist
    it leaves you at the file already selected.

[VIEW COMMAND]:
    Prints the doc of the file currently selected, which explains what the file does
    and how to use the file.

[SOURCE CODE CONCERNS]:
    If you are wondering why the source code for the files seems to be more complicated
    then it should be. It would be due to the fact that all files in the "branchless-program"
    file are, well branchless. None of the files here SHOULD contain if statements.
